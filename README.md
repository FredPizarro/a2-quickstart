## Install packages
Using npm from the command line, install the packages listed in package.json with the command:

```
npm install
```
Error messages—in red—might appear during the install, and you might see npm WARN messages. As long as there are no npm ERR! messages at the end, you can assume success.

If the typings folder doesn't show up after running npm install, you'll need to install it manually with the command:

```
npm run typings install
```

You're now ready to write some code!
